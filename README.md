## Introduction to Technical Writing
### Why technical writing is important
* Marketing: you have to sell you product
* Gets information out of your head: people will stop asking you for it
* Gets the team "On the same page"
* Reduce support calls: (User manuals)
* An auditor might want to know (decisions, solutions)
* It's a direct reflection of you (you should write documentation for people not for you)

### Agile documentation tips
#### (you have to write documentation but not detail)
* Essential (Document with just barely good enough detail)
* Valuable (The benefit of having documentation must outweight the cost of creating and maintaining it)
* Timely (Documentation should be done in just-in-time manner, when we need it)
