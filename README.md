# Documentation
## Introduction to Technical Writing
### Why technical writing is important
* Marketing: you have to sell you product
* Gets information out of your head: people will stop asking you for it
* Gets the team "On the same page"
* Reduce support calls: (User manuals)
* An auditor might want to know (decisions, solutions)
* It's a direct reflection of you (you should write documentation for people not for you)

### Agile documentation tips
#### (you have to write documentation but not detail)
* Essential (Document with just barely good enough detail)
* Valuable (The benefit of having documentation must outweight the cost of creating and maintaining it)
* Timely (Documentation should be done in just-in-time manner, when we need it)

### Common Technical Documents
* Case studies
* Description
* Emails
* Letters
* Instructions and procedures
* Memos
* Press releases
* Proposals
* Resumes and job applications
* Specifications
* Technical reports
* White papers
* Websites

* Design/Architecture - Defines how the system will be constructed, describing critical components and how they fit together
* Code/Technical - Enable task completion and understanding
* Test Plans/Test Cases - Define the approach to testing; expose errors or demonstrate correct behavior
* End-User - Enable task completion; provide support and troubleshooting
#### Audience
