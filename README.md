# Documentation
## Introduction to Technical Writing
### Why technical writing is important
* Marketing: you have to sell you product
* Gets information out of your head: people will stop asking you for it
* Gets the team "On the same page"
* Reduce support calls: (User manuals)
* An auditor might want to know (decisions, solutions)
* It's a direct reflection of you (you should write documentation for people not for you)

### Agile documentation tips
#### (you have to write documentation but not detail)
* Essential (Document with just barely good enough detail)
* Valuable (The benefit of having documentation must outweight the cost of creating and maintaining it)
* Timely (Documentation should be done in just-in-time manner, when we need it)

### Common Technical Documents
* Case studies
* Description
* Emails
* Letters
* Instructions and procedures
* Memos
* Press releases
* Proposals
* Resumes and job applications
* Specifications
* Technical reports
* White papers
* Websites

## The writing process

### Plan phase
#### Purpose
* Requirements - Identify what is to be built, and to verify we’re meeting stakeholders’ expectations
* Design/Architecture - Defines how the system will be constructed, describing critical components and how they fit together
* Code/Technical - Enable task completion and understanding
* Test Plans/Test Cases - Define the approach to testing; expose errors or demonstrate correct behavior
* End-User - Enable task completion; provide support and troubleshooting
#### Audience

#### Delivery
* ask questions where this documentation will be use (web sites, documents)
### Research
* Interview Subject matters Experts
* Review Existing Documentation
* Use the Software
### Write
* Organize you content and ideas (chronological, parts of an object, simple to complex, specific to general)
* Write the first draft
* Check (sentence and paragraph structure, grammar, word choice, spelling)
### Review/edit
* Adjust and reorgonize content
* Editing for style
* Editing for grammar and punctuation
* Revise to incorporate test results
* Usability Testing (line by line testing if guideline works)
### Launch
* Handle translation, if applicable
* Bundle up artifacts
* Coordinate with delopment team and other writers to release
* Create a plan for updates
## Writing tips and best practices 
* Accuracy (document, stylistic, technical)
* Clarity (write weel steps with all details, so the people who doesn't know can do through document from first time)
* Be specific (don't use abstract words)
* Use active voice to describe actions (Check screens A and B for errors)
* Be strong. And say what you mean (assume, depends on, shows, illustrates, requires, needs to, uses differed sometimes, unknown)
* Use shorts sentences
* Use images, charts to describe information
* Use Present tense and be consistence.
## Layout and design 
* Typography (Use typography appropriate for the format and intended use; Focus on readability and understandability using size, contrast and bold/italics)
* Design Principles (Alignment creates a visual connection between elements; Center alignment is usually not as strong as right or left;
Elements closer together are perceived to be more related than elements farther apart; Use contrast to make important elements stand out; Whitespace lets a design breathe, and separates groups of information)
* Page Design Elements (Increase the effectiveness of a document through: Table of contents, Revision history, Headers and footers, Lists/bullets, Captions, Glossary)
* Visuals (Keep visuals simple; If explanation is needed, use a caption; Refer to visuals in the text of the document by their figure or table numbers; Place visuals as close as possible to the text where they are discussed; Consider placing detailed or lengthy visuals in an appendix)

# Deliverables
